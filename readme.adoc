*THIS TOOL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND MAY NOT WORK AS EXPECTED. PLEASE BE PATIENT UNTIL WE MAKE A WORKING SOLUTION !*

== building

run the build.sh batch file.

== Install plugins

depending on your OS, download either a .dll or .so of the plugin, and put it in the plugins folder.

If this folder does not exist, create it yourself. JavalessMC alone is useless, as it just create a player that do nothing.

== Create plugins

In the future, an api and an exemple will be published, with documentation. For now, please wait until we get to this part of developpement.
